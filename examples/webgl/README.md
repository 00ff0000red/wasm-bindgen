# WebGL Example

This directory is an example of using the `web-sys` crate to interact with
a WebGL context.

You can build and run the example with:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

(or running the commands on Windows manually)

and then opening up `http://localhost:8080/` in a web browser should show a
nice triangle.
