# `Math`

[View this example online](https://webassembly.studio/?f=ffnm4kpzmib)

This directory is an example of using the `#[wasm_bindgen]` macro to import the
`Math` object and invoke various functions on it.

You can build the example with:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

(or running the commands on Windows manually)

and then opening up `index.html` in a web browser should show a dialog!
